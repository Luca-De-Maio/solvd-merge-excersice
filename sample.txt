A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting gravitational
acceleration so strong that nothing—no particles or even 
electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from it.
The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently 
compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.
The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is 
called the event amost horizon i think, or that's wath i would expect.
